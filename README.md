**ðŸš€ Ultimate Template for Modern .NET Applications: Clean Architecture + Vertical Slice Architecture with CQRS**  

This powerful template brings together **Clean Architecture** and **Vertical Slice Architecture** into a seamless structure, designed to help .NET developers build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. Whether you're starting a new project or upgrading an existing one, this template is your go-to foundation for modern software development.  

### **Key Features**  

1. **Hybrid Architecture**  
   - Combines the best of **Clean Architecture** (ensuring separation of concerns and testability) with **Vertical Slice Architecture** (encouraging feature-driven development for modular, independent slices).  

2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**  
   - Built with the CQRS pattern to clearly separate **read** and **write** operations, making the codebase more organized and easier to scale.  

3. **Domain-Driven Design Principles**  
   - Keeps business logic at the core, adhering to DDD concepts for domain modeling and validation.  

4. **Vertical Slices for Features**  
   - Each feature is structured as an independent, self-contained slice, including all layers (command, query, domain, and infrastructure) within the same module.  
   - No unnecessary coupling between slices, resulting in modular and maintainable code.  

5. **Clean Separation of Concerns**  
   - Layers are strictly segregated:  
     - **Presentation Layer**: Handles API endpoints, controllers, and input validation.  
     - **Application Layer**: Processes business logic, CQRS handlers, and mediates between other layers.  
     - **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and rules.  
     - **Infrastructure Layer**: External dependencies like database access, logging, and third-party integrations.  

6. **Built-in Mediator Pattern**  
   - Uses **MediatR** or similar libraries to handle communication between commands and queries, promoting loosely coupled components.  

7. **Validation Framework**  
   - Integrates with **FluentValidation** for clean and reusable validation rules at the application layer.  

8. **Exception Handling & Problem Details**  
   - Standardized error handling with **ProblemDetails** ensures API clients receive consistent and meaningful error responses.  

9. **Dependency Injection**  
   - Fully integrated DI setup, making it easy to register and resolve services across different layers.  

10. **Ready-to-Use Best Practices**  
    - Repository pattern (optional based on developer preference).  
    - Supports async programming and asynchronous disposable patterns.  
    - To come: Layered testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.  

11. **Extensibility**  
    - The template allows for easy customization to suit your project's unique needs, including adding new slices without impacting existing functionality.  

12. **Modern Development Tools**  
    - Fully compatible with **.NET 8+**, ensuring you're using the latest and greatest tools for your development.  

### **Who Is This For?**  
- Developers who want to leverage the structured, scalable design of Clean Architecture.  
- Teams looking for a modular approach to feature development with Vertical Slice Architecture.  
- Those adopting CQRS for improved readability and maintainability in complex applications.  
- Beginners and professionals aiming to start a new project with a rock-solid foundation.  

### **Why Choose This Template?**  
This template eliminates the complexities of setting up a Clean Architecture-based project while incorporating the feature-first flexibility of Vertical Slice Architecture. It's optimized for productivity, scalability, and modern development best practices.  

### **Get Started**  
Use this template as the starting point for your next .NET project. Let it handle the architectural groundwork while you focus on building amazing features.
